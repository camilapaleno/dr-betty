                <span id="quote">"People come to me after they have been to other doctors, failed at fad diets and have been in pain for so long that they have forgotten what it's like to wake up in the morning feeling well. They have all but given up. So they are shocked when they leave my office not with a list of prescriptions or an impossible diet regimen, but with a sense of hope, maybe a nutritional product or two to support their growth toward wellness. Because being well is what it is all about."</span>
                <br><br>
                Dr. Betty Ehrlich has been at the helm of a thriving chiropractic and nutrition practice for over three decades, and has worked with thousands of patients from Southern California and around the country. 
                <br><br>
                <span id="quote">"I saw physicians putting patients on all kinds of drugs, that eased their pain somewhat, but never really addressed their underlying disorders, and burdened the patients with side effects that were sometimes as bad as the pain itself."</span>
                <br><br>
                While chiropractic care helps many of Betty's patients suffering from neck and back injuries, sports injuries and chronic headaches, there were a number for whom the underlying problem ran deeper. 
                <br><br>
                <span id="quote">"It is time we doctors, both M.D.'s and Chiropractors, started looking at whole people instead of a list of complaints. It is time we started rebuilding their health at a cellular level." </span>
                <br><br>
                Her challenge to new patients is a simple one:
                <br><br>
                <span id="quote">"Let me be your coach. Health from the inside out is what you will achieve. There are no drugs and no invasive treatments. Essential Health is a safe place. You know from the get go that there is no miracle cure. You will not lose 10 pounds in two days as so many billboards for unhealthy diets claim, nor will you be totally free of all of your health issues in one visit. But if you give it your best, I will too. This process will be exciting, and when we get where we are headed, you will be the best that you can be! </span>

            <p>The safety of our patients and their families is a high priority at Essential Health.
                <br><br>We prescreen by asking patients during appointment reminder or scheduling calls if they are suffering from any Covid-19 symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, runny nose, sore throat, or a loss of taste or smell.
                Also travel history and we outline office protocols regarding times and spacing appointments to avoid overlap.
                We offer facemasks, cleanser sprat, hand disinfectant, and tissues.
